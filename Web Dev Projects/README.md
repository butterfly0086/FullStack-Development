## Web Dev Folder
If you have any web dev project and want to show case it to other people then this is a good opportunity for you.  
All you have to do is upload your project folder under "Web Dev folder". Make sure you aren't messing up the main folder with your files.  
Don't forget to deploy it on gh-page or netlify or heroku or any other source to show the live preview.  
At last but not the least, create a readme file and embed live preview link in it.  
You can design readme as you like 😉 


# What is HacktoberFest
Hacktoberfest is open to everyone in our global community. Whether you’re a developer, student learning to code, event host, or company of any size, you can help drive growth of open source and make positive contributions to an ever-growing community. All backgrounds and skill levels are encouraged to complete the challenge.

1. Hacktoberfest is a celebration open to everyone in our global community.
2. Pull requests can be made in any GitHub-hosted repositories/projects.
3. You can sign up anytime between October 1 and October 31.

# Rules 
  🌟 To earn your Hacktoberfest t-shirt or tree reward, you must register and make four valid pull requests (PRs) between October 1-31 (in any time zone). PRs can be made to any public repo on GitHub, not only the ones with issues labeled Hacktoberfest. If a maintainer reports your pull request as spam or behavior not in line with the project’s code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate.
